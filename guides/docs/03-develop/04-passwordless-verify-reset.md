# Passwordless, Verify Email and Password Reset

There is one thing that Passwordless, Verify Email and Password Rest have in common: Email. Before we can enable those features we first have to configure our email settings which you can do in the admin dashboard inside the settings tab. Once you have your email set up, you can go to `Sign In Methods` and enable `Authentication Link`, `Reset Password` and `Verify Email`.

**Note:** In most cases you will use port 587.
