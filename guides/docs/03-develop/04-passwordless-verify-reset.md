# Passwordless, Verify Email, and Password Reset

Passwordless, Verify Email, and Password Reset have one thing in common: email. Before you can enable these features, you need to configure your email settings in the admin dashboard, under the settings tab. Once you have your email set up, you can go to `Sign In Methods` and enable `Authentication Link`, `Reset Password`, and `Verify Email`.

**Note**: In most cases, you will use port 587 in your SMTP settings.
